## ⚡ Quick Install

Run in PowerShell from your project directory:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ogulcan27/stay-in-the-loop/v1.0.0/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer asks where to install:

```text
[1] Project
    Current project only

[2] Personal
    All local Claude Code projects
```

Then start the workflow in Claude Code:

```text
/stay-in-the-loop
```

**Inspect first?** Download the script, read it, then run it:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ogulcan27/stay-in-the-loop/v1.0.0/scripts/install.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1
notepad install.ps1
.\install.ps1
```

If your execution policy blocks local scripts, run `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1` instead.

## Why Stay in the Loop?

AI coding agents can move through a project faster than you can understand every decision and implementation detail. The code works, but your mental model of it falls behind.

Stay in the Loop closes that comprehension gap. When you choose to, it reviews the work that has been done, explains what changed and why, teaches the concepts you actually need, and keeps that knowledge for your next project.

## How It Works

```text
AI-assisted project work
          ↓
  /stay-in-the-loop
          ↓
      Understand
          ↓
   Learn if needed
          ↓
       Connect
          ↓
        Retain
```

- **Understand.** It finds project work you have not caught up on, using persistent evidence such as git commits, plan documents, and issue keys, and summarizes it for you.
- **Learn if needed.** Only changes you must understand, and do not yet, become learning material. Routine changes are skipped.
- **Connect.** Concepts are linked into a per-project knowledge map.
- **Retain.** Reusable concepts and project experience are stored so they carry across projects.

Stay in the Loop is manual by design. It runs only when you type `/stay-in-the-loop`. Normal project work never starts it, and there is no background tracking.

System Design is the primary learning axis. Data structures and algorithms appear only when they are computationally relevant.

## Core Learning Model

| Understand | Learn | Retain |
|---|---|---|
| **Human Synchronization** | **Light / Full ULA** | **Semantic Graph + Persistence** |
| Understand what changed and why. | Learn only what matters, to the depth required. | Connect reusable knowledge and experience over time. |

ULA (Universal Learning Architecture) has two depths. Light ULA produces a short learning note. Full ULA is a three-stage process (architect, build, audit) and asks for your approval before building content. Every run ends with an integrity check across all stored knowledge.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/stay-in-the-loop` | Run the full workflow; asks for scope when several work units are open. |
| `/stay-in-the-loop latest` | Catch up on the most recent work unit only. |
| `/stay-in-the-loop pending` | Return to deferred or partially covered work. |
| `/stay-in-the-loop catch-up` | Work through all open gaps. |
| `/stay-in-the-loop resume` | Continue an unfinished learning pass. |
| `/stay-in-the-loop map` | Show the project knowledge map. |
| `/stay-in-the-loop map <node-id>` | Zoom into one concept (add `L1`–`L4` for a depth view). |
| `/stay-in-the-loop concept <concept-id>` | Show a concept's home page. |
| `/stay-in-the-loop library` | Show the Personal Technical Library. |
| `/stay-in-the-loop experiences` | List project experience notes. |
| `/stay-in-the-loop debt` | List open knowledge debt: gaps left for later. |
| `/stay-in-the-loop integrity` | Check stored knowledge and suggest safe repairs. |

More arguments (`show skipped`, `new`, `abandon <pass-id>`, `map debt`, `map sync`, `<work-unit-id>`) are listed in [`SKILL.md`](.claude/skills/stay-in-the-loop/SKILL.md).

## Installation

| Scope | Installs to | Available in |
|---|---|---|
| Project | `<project>/.claude/skills/stay-in-the-loop/` | That repository only |
| Personal | `~/.claude/skills/stay-in-the-loop/` | All local Claude Code projects |

The Quick Install above covers most users. Other options:

**Clone and install** (the most inspectable path):

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/ogulcan27/stay-in-the-loop.git
cd stay-in-the-loop
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\install.ps1 -Scope Project -ProjectPath C:\path\to\your-project
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\install.ps1 -Scope Personal
```

**Non-interactive.** Pass `-Scope Project` or `-Scope Personal` to skip the menu. `-Repository <owner/repo>` and `-Ref <tag-or-commit>` override the defaults (`ogulcan27/stay-in-the-loop`, `v1.0.0`). With `irm | iex` you cannot pass parameters, so use the scriptblock form:

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ogulcan27/stay-in-the-loop/v1.0.0/scripts/install.ps1))) -Scope Personal
```

**Release package.** Each GitHub Release provides `stay-in-the-loop-v1.0.0.zip` and `SHA256SUMS.txt`:

```powershell
(Get-FileHash .\stay-in-the-loop-v1.0.0.zip -Algorithm SHA256).Hash.ToLower()
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1 -Scope Project -Archive .\stay-in-the-loop-v1.0.0.zip
```

**What the installer guarantees:**

- Every file is checked against the SHA256 manifest before anything is written.
- An identical install is reported as `ALREADY INSTALLED`. A different version is never overwritten silently; use `update.ps1` or `-Force`.
- Installation is staged and swapped in atomically. On failure, the previous install is restored.
- It only touches `.claude/skills/stay-in-the-loop/`. Your learning state, Personal Technical Library, `CLAUDE.md`, source code, git history, and other skills are left alone.

**Project and Personal together.** When the same skill exists in several scopes, Claude Code uses **enterprise > personal > project**, so a Personal install wins over a Project install. Use one scope unless you intentionally manage that precedence.

On macOS or Linux, copy `.claude/skills/stay-in-the-loop/` from a release manually. This path is untested.

## Project State and Personal Knowledge

| Layer | Location | Written by |
|---|---|---|
| Skill engine | `.claude/skills/stay-in-the-loop/` | The installer only |
| Project learning state | `docs/learning/` in your project | `/stay-in-the-loop` |
| Personal Technical Library | Configured separately (`personal_library_path`) | `/stay-in-the-loop`, only when configured |

Updating or uninstalling Stay in the Loop does not delete project learning state or the Personal Technical Library.

On the first run in a project, the skill asks for your approval before creating `docs/learning/`. Committing that directory to your repository is your choice.

The **Personal Technical Library** follows *One Concept, One Home*: each concept has one canonical page that all your projects link to. Its location is set in `docs/learning/state/LEARNING_CONFIG.md`. If it is not configured, the skill asks whether to set it up, keep knowledge local to the project, or decide later.

## Updating

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\update.ps1 -Scope Project -ProjectPath C:\path\to\your-project
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\update.ps1 -Scope Personal -Ref <tag>
```

Updates replace only the skill engine, atomically and with rollback. Restart any open Claude Code session afterwards.

## Uninstalling

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\uninstall.ps1 -Scope Project -ProjectPath C:\path\to\your-project
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\uninstall.ps1 -Scope Personal
```

Only the skill directory is removed. To verify an install instead, run `scripts\verify-install.ps1` with the same parameters; it reports `PASS` or `FAIL`.

## Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| Runtime | Claude Code with skills support (tested with 2.1.311) |
| Installer | Windows PowerShell 5.1+ (tested on 5.1) |
| Git | Optional; used as project evidence when present |
| Development tests | Python 3, standard library only |

Python is not required to use the skill. The skill is plain Markdown: no binaries, no dependencies, no network calls.

## Current Limitations

- **Language.** Version 1.0.0 currently uses Turkish for generated learning explanations, with technical terms in English. Configurable learning-output language is not part of V1.
- **Platform.** Current V1 integration: Claude Code. Other agents such as Codex, Gemini CLI, or Cursor are not supported; they are possible future adapters.
- **Installer.** Tested only on Windows PowerShell 5.1.
- **Scope.** The knowledge map is per project. The Personal Technical Library is single-machine; there is no remote or shared library.
- **Judgment.** Some decisions, such as whether two concepts are the same, rely on the agent's judgment. When unsure, the skill asks you.
- **Cost.** Full ULA uses significant tokens, so it runs only for concepts that need it.

## Security

- The skill itself is Markdown instructions. It runs no code of its own and makes no network requests.
- Quick Install runs a remote PowerShell script. Running a remote script executes code from the referenced repository; inspect it first if you prefer, and pin a tag or commit.
- SHA256 verification protects package integrity: it detects corrupted, incomplete, or modified files. It is not publisher authentication, because the manifest comes from the same source.

## Development

```text
uv run --no-project python tests/run_all.py     # or: python tests/run_all.py
```

The suite uses only the Python standard library. It covers the protocol models, end-to-end integration, a static audit, the installer (Windows PowerShell), and mutation checks. Build the release package with `scripts\build-release.ps1`. Development audit records are in [`docs/audit/`](docs/audit/), and the architecture map is in [`docs/audit/V1_ARCHITECTURE_MANIFEST.md`](docs/audit/V1_ARCHITECTURE_MANIFEST.md).

Versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/): MAJOR for breaking state or protocol changes, MINOR for compatible capabilities, PATCH for compatible fixes. See [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) and the [v1.0.0 release notes](docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v1.0.0.md).
